# Agent Conventions

## Scratch / debug workspace

- **Always** use `./debug/` for any scratch files, downloaded CI logs,
  temporary scripts, ad-hoc outputs, etc.
- **Never** use `/tmp/` or any other system-wide temp directory.
- `./debug/` is gitignored at the repo level (see `.gitignore`); files
  there persist across the session and are easy to inspect.

Examples:

```bash
# good
gh api /repos/.../actions/jobs/<id>/logs > ./debug/job-<id>.log

# bad
gh api /repos/.../actions/jobs/<id>/logs > /tmp/job-<id>.log
```

This applies to subagents too — when delegating execution work, instruct
the subagent to write to `./debug/` rather than `/tmp/`.
