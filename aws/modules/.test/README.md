# Testing

## Requirements

To gather all specifics versions of this project, we use:
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) version manager (see [installation](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)).
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command runner
  - install it using asdf: `asdf plugin add just && asdf install just`

Then we will install all the tooling listed in the `.tool-versions` of this root project using just:
```bash
just install-tooling

# list available recipes
just --list
```

## Configure AWSCli

You should now have `awscli` installed, verify it with: `aws --version`

Make sure that your aws cli is configured with a proper AWS Profile and a region:

**Aws Cli Auth**: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-authentication-user.html#cli-authentication-user-configure.title

```bash
export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=<profile-name>
# you can also use
# export AWS_PROFILE=<profile-name>

export AWS_REGION=eu-central-1

# if you are using sso
aws sso login --profile "$AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE"

# verify that you are correctly authenticated
aws eks list-clusters
```

## Configure the tests

The tests will create resources on AWS using the provided account

By default, a random uuid is assigned and prepended to the end of each object created.

If you want to specify a non-random cluster UID:
```bash
export TESTS_CLUSTER_ID="myTest"
```

If you don't want to delete the resources at the end of the test:
```bash
export CLEAN_CLUSTER_AT_THE_END=false
```

The tf states are stored by default in a S3 bucket, if you want to configure the bucket name and the bucket region:
```bash
export TF_STATE_BUCKET="myBucket"
export TF_STATE_BUCKET_REGION="eu-central-1"
```

You can change the default deployment region:
```bash
export TESTS_CLUSTER_REGION="eu-west-1"
```

You can change the terraform binary (default is `terraform`):
```bash
export TESTS_TF_BINARY_NAME="tofu"
```

### Run the tests

Test with:

```bash
# Launch all the tests
just aws-tf-modules-test

# if you want the live output
just aws-tf-modules-tests-verbose

# or just test one case
just aws-tf-modules-test-verbose TestUpgradeEKSTestSuite
```

When you run the test, terratest will create a copy of the module to be tested in the `./.test/states` directory.
You can later navigate to the directory and use its content to manipulate the cluster.

The `.test` folder is called this way as we keep it close to the modules due to the monorepo structure and additionally we're making use of a terratest function that copies the modules folder to allow running tests in parallel on the same machine. By "hiding" the folder, the function does not copy the test folder anymore otherwise it would result in an endless path and crash the test.

**Local development note:**
You can set the `SKIP_XXX` variable to prevent unique IDs of tests from being generated each time, thus using the same resources instead of deploying new resources with terraform.

## Troubleshooting

Ensure you don't have test clusters running for a while:

```bash
eksctl get clusters
```
