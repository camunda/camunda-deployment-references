# Camunda Deployment References

This repository provides a set of reference architectures, implemented in Terraform, for various cloud providers. These examples are designed to help you quickly set up Camunda 8. In addition to Terraform templates, you'll find minimal setups for running Camunda 8 using the Helm chart or deploying via the single JAR. These references are intended to serve as a foundation for customization and improvement. While your organization will likely need to make adjustments for a production-ready deployment, these examples will accelerate your journey.

## Motivation

Our goal is to help you get started with Camunda 8 in days, not months, by simplifying the process of setting up the underlying infrastructureâ€”a common initial challenge.

## How to Use

The reference architecture implementations are intended for two main use cases:

1. **Reference**: Use these example implementations as guidance to help you build your own solution. Often, users bring their own infrastructure and simply need help with the missing components or confirmation of their existing setup.
2. **Copy & Paste**: You can copy these reference architectures as-is, using them as a starting point. Modify and extend them to meet your specific requirements.
